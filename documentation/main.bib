    Abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing classical force fields constitute the cornerstone of contemporary atomistic modeling in chemistry, biology, and materials science. However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations.},

abstract  ="Traditional force fields cannot model chemical reactivity{,} and suffer from low generality without re-fitting. Neural network potentials promise to address these problems{,} offering energies and forces with near ab initio accuracy at low cost. However a data-driven approach is naturally inefficient for long-range interatomic forces that have simple physical formulas. In this manuscript we construct a hybrid model chemistry consisting of a nearsighted neural network potential with screened long-range electrostatic and van der Waals physics. This trained potential{,} simply dubbed “TensorMol-0.1”{,} is offered in an open-source Python package capable of many of the simulation types commonly used to study chemistry: geometry optimizations{,} harmonic spectra{,} open or periodic molecular dynamics{,} Monte Carlo{,} and nudged elastic band calculations. We describe the robustness and speed of the package{,} demonstrating its millihartree accuracy and scalability to tens-of-thousands of atoms on ordinary laptops. We demonstrate the performance of the model by reproducing vibrational spectra{,} and simulating the molecular dynamics of a protein. Our comparisons with electronic structure theory and experimental data demonstrate that neural network molecular dynamics is poised to become an important tool for molecular simulation{,} lowering the resource barrier to simulating chemistry."}

abstract  ="Machine learning has emerged as an invaluable tool in many research areas. In the present work{,} we harness this power to predict highly accurate molecular infrared spectra with unprecedented computational efficiency. To account for vibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects – typically neglected by conventional quantum chemistry approaches – we base our machine learning strategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations are usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules{,} we overcome these limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning techniques{,} not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude{,} but also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this end{,} we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent neural network charges and combine it with the neural network potential approach of Behler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy{,} we are able to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of infrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference points. This is made possible through the use of molecular forces during neural network potential training and the introduction of a fully automated sampling scheme. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying it to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule{,} n-alkanes containing up to 200 atoms and the protonated alanine tripeptide{,} which at the same time represents the first application of machine learning techniques to simulate the dynamics of a peptide. In all of these case studies we find an excellent agreement between the infrared spectra predicted via machine learning models and the respective theoretical and experimental spectra."}
